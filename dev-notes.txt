To edit BOOKING (Calendar) function:
    > You may edit the following files

        - templates/apps/ecommerce/ecommerce-booking.html
            -> This is where you will mostly have changes in terms of the interface

        - static/js/pages/calendar.init.js
            -> Edit this if you want to change something from the calendar behavior

        - apps/views.py | included class-based views are:
            - AjaxFunctionsView -> handles all ajax request from ecommerce-booking.html
            - EcommerceBookingView -> handles the get, post, put (or edit), and delete methods

        - apps/forms.py | included forms are:
            - BookingForm -> mainly for validating start datetime


To edit the PROFILES of Client, Company, Owner, Employee and User:
    > You may edit the following files

        - templates/apps/profiles/
            -> Each has their own list and profile pages

        - templates/apps/profiles/profile-form.html
            -> Form for new records and editing records

        - apps/views.py | included class-based views are:
            - UserView 
                -> handles the get and post requests (post is also used when edit is submitted)
                -> since the profiles essentially have the same logic, condensed into one "UserView"

        - apps/forms.py | included forms are:
            - BaseProfileForm 
                -> the main form that has an overriden save method
                -> inherited by the forms: ClientForm, CompanyForm, OwnerForm, EmployeeForm
            - NewUserForm & EditUserForm -> for actual user accounts
